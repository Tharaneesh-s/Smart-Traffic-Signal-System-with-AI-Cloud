
Smart Traffic Signal System – Work Process
1. Vehicle Detection & Traffic Analysis

   Uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to detect and count vehicles at intersections.
   Classifies vehicles (cars, buses, emergency vehicles, etc.) and analyzes traffic density.

2. Emergency Vehicle Tracking

GPS module tracks the real-time location of ambulances, fire trucks, etc.
System detects approaching emergency vehicles and adjusts signals to clear their path.

3. Dynamic Traffic Signal Control

AI-based adaptive timing: Signal duration is adjusted based on real-time traffic conditions.
Reduces congestion by prioritizing roads with higher vehicle counts.
Works efficiently for peak and off-peak hours.

4. Cloud Integration & Communication

Traffic data is uploaded to Google Cloud for analysis and monitoring.
Uses MQTT protocol to send real-time updates to traffic controllers and dashboards.

5. Traffic Light Control (Output System)

ESP32/ESP8266 microcontrollers receive optimized traffic signal timing.
Manages LED traffic lights dynamically based on AI analysis.
Ensures emergency vehicles get a green light while others are stopped.

6. Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts

Web-based dashboard displays real-time traffic conditions and system performance.
Sends automated alerts for congestion, accidents, or hardware failures.
Data logs help in long-term traffic planning and optimization.

Key Benefits

✅ Reduces congestion by optimizing signal timing.
✅ Prioritizes emergency vehicles for faster response times.
✅ Uses AI & IoT for real-time decision-making.
✅ Cloud-based monitoring for traffic authorities.

This system ensures smarter and more efficient traffic management.
